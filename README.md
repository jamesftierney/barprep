Bar prep
========

I passed the bar exam in July 2011. The key to my study strategy was the Anki flash card program. It uses spaced repetition to drill concepts that are harder for you. (After looking at a flash card's answer, you rate it for how easy it is --- and it will prioritize showing you harder-rated cards in the future.) 

I made an Anki deck for the Massachusetts bar exam, which at the time was MBE multiple choice and essays with state law distinctions. There are about 2600 cards overall, separated into the different categories you would expect to see on the exam.

I have not reviewed the content of the Anki deck since July 2011, and make no warranties about its correctness or usefulness. I offer it as-is.
